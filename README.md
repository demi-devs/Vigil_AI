**Vigilante-AI**

This AI-powered phishing detector is a browser extension designed to protect users from malicious websites. By analyzing URLs and web page content, it identifies potential phishing threats and warns the user before they can be compromised.

Features
Real-time Protection: The extension continuously monitors web pages and analyzes URLs as you browse.

AI-powered Detection: It uses artificial intelligence to analyze various factors for identifying phishing attempts, such as:

URL analysis: Checks for suspicious characters, misspellings, and misleading domain names (e.g., paypa1.com instead of paypal.com).

Domain reputation: Cross-references the URL with blacklists of known malicious sites.

Content analysis: Scans for red flags within the page content, like urgent language, fake logos, or requests for sensitive information.

Customizable Sensitivity: You can adjust the detection sensitivity to low, medium, or high, allowing you to fine-tune the balance between security and false positives.

Whitelist/Blacklist Management: Users can manually whitelist trusted sites or blacklist malicious ones to personalize their protection.

Statistics Dashboard: The extension provides a dashboard with statistics on pages checked, threats blocked, and warnings issued.

How It Works
The detector uses a combination of techniques to assess the legitimacy of a website. When you navigate to a new page, the extension's script analyzes the URL and page content using a pre-trained machine learning model. This model looks for a variety of indicators that are commonly associated with phishing sites. For example, it might identify that a site's URL has an unusually high number of dots or that the page is asking for sensitive information like a password without a secure connection (HTTPS). Based on this analysis, it assigns a risk score and takes action: blocking the site, issuing a warning, or doing nothing.
